# codechef-solutions

Solutions for CodeChef problems that I have solved.

Most solutions are written in C++.

The solutions can be found in the 'Solutions' folder and the file name is the CodeChef code for the problem.

There may be some corrupt/empty/incorrectly named files. Feel free to open issues and tell me about them.

We can also discuss the efficiency, correctness, and just about anything related to any question.

You won't find solutions to currently running contests here :P
